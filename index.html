            <p>Welcome to a special website dedicated to the most amazing person, NICOLE!!!!.</p>

            <h2>Timeline</h2>
            <p>We met on an NCEA discord server where she added me, and I accepted it, then we started talking. We went from acquaintances, to friends, to best friends then we stopped talking. Became best friends again, then we started talking more and more, it became a situationship. We flirted more and more, then I asked her out where i made her a ribbon rose bouquet and a letter where she hugged me, which made me confused if she said yes or no. I asked her if she did want to be my girlfriend, she nodded and i couldnt tell if she nodded, so I made sure i heard a yes from her.</p>
            <blockquote>During the first month</blockquote>
            <p>During our month together, NGL I WAS SUPER AWKWARD. I DIDNT KNOW HOW TO REACT AFTER I GOT HOME. Because I did not een expect you to say yes to me HAHAHA. Anyways during the first month, we had our ups and downs, we learnt a lot from each other with built out relationship. Especially doing the questions (we need to do more we've barely done any this second month), learning more about each other which I thought was interesting and taught me how to love you much much better.</p>
            <blockquote>A MONTH LATER...</blockquote>
            <p>After our one month anniversary, I cried on what she gave me as a one month present because it was actually so thoughtful. So I had to think of something to top that and I thought of THIS!! But after a month, me and her started to get more comfortable with each other, and yk... HAHAHAH. We became more closer and communicated much better, and now we're in the healthiest relationship ever and still continuing. We've been so busy lately because we are absolute academic weapons. But I cant wait to meet you in two weeks my princess.</p>
